**Overview**

This project contains the database design and SQL queries for AUT Motors, developed as part of the BUS5DWR Data Wrangling course. It includes a normalized database schema, SQL queries for retrieving sales data, and insights derived from analyzing product and employee performance.

**Main Goal**

The main goal of this project is to help AUT Motors gain insights from their data by using SQL to organize, manage, and analyze it. The project focuses on data cleaning, normalization, and writing efficient queries to extract key business metrics from the company's sales and employee data.

**Key Sections**

Database Normalization: The data has been structured according to 3rd Normal Form (3NF) to minimize redundancy and improve query performance.
SQL Queries: Several queries were written to retrieve important business insights such as product catalogues, top-performing categories, and top-performing employees.
Business Insights: Queries provided actionable insights that can help AUT Motors with decision-making related to product performance and employee efficiency.

**Database Setup**

- Import the SQL script file included in the repository into your SQL Server.
- The SQL script will create the required tables and insert sample data.

**Run the Queries**

- Execute the provided SQL queries to extract insights on:
- Product information (catalog, categories, unit prices).
- Sales performance by product category.
- Employee performance based on the number of orders handled.

**Technologies Used**

- SQL Server: Used for database management and querying.
- GitHub: For version control and sharing the project codebase.
